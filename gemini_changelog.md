# Gemini Agent Change Log

This document summarizes the changes made by the Gemini agent to debug and fix the lineup manager functionality.

### 1. `theme/templates/base.html`

-   **Change:** Added an empty `{% block extra_js %}{% endblock %}` right before the closing `</body>` tag.
-   **Reason:** This was the first critical fix. The base template was missing this block, which silently prevented any child templates (like `lineup_manager.html`) from adding their own JavaScript files to the page.

### 2. `league/views.py`

-   **Change 1:** Refactored the `get_team_lineup_context` function to build a complete JSON payload for the JavaScript, which is now stored in a `js_data` key.
-   **Change 2:** Updated the `build_lineup_context` function to pass the correct editing permissions into `get_team_lineup_context`.
-   **Reason:** To fix the core data pipeline issue. The original view passed data to the template in a complex way that was causing JavaScript errors. This change simplifies the logic by preparing the exact data structure needed by the JavaScript directly in the view.

### 3. `static/js/lineup-manager.js`

-   **Change:** Removed the `DOMContentLoaded` event listener from the bottom of the file.
-   **Reason:** The responsibility for initializing the `LineupManager` classes was moved from this file directly into the Django template. This makes the script a reusable class definition and gives us more control over its execution.

### 4. `league/templates/lineup_manager.html`

This file went through the most changes as we diagnosed the problem:

-   **Change 1:** The complex and error-prone inline `<script>` used to process data was completely removed.
-   **Change 2:** It was replaced with two simple and safe `json_script` tags (`home-team-data` and `away-team-data`) to embed the data prepared by the view.
-   **Change 3:** The entire file's content was rewritten to restore the correct HTML structure (the team panels, pitch, etc.) that was accidentally removed during a previous step.
-   **Change 4:** A new `<script>` was added inside the `{% block extra_js %}`. This script now handles the final initialization, reading the data from the `json_script` tags and creating the `LineupManager` objects with robust error logging.

### 5. `league/templatetags/lineup_extras.py`

-   **Change:** The `yojson` template filter was deleted.
-   **Reason:** After refactoring the data pipeline in `views.py`, this custom filter was no longer necessary.

*This log summarizes the progressive diagnosis and resolution of the issue, starting with the file loading failure, moving to the data pipeline errors, and ending with a robust JavaScript initialization pattern.*
